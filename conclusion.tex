\todo{OLD, TO BE REWORKED}

In this paper, we introduced \aser, a novel extension of the classical
{\asl} language. The language provides encapsulation for agent
goals, which clearly improves legibility and reusability of AgentSpeak
code. Furthermore, the new language improves some of the shortcomings
of AgentSpeak in regards to goal orientation and declarative goals by
ensuring that all reactive plans are also associated with general
goals, providing a ``goal condition'' which means goals can be still
active even though presently there is no action for the agent to take
towards that goal, and allowing external events (i.e., reactions to
changes in beliefs) to trigger various plans, for all the goals it
might be relevant.  We formalised the main changes required in the
existing formal semantics of AgentSpeak and experimentally evaluated
an interpreter for \aser\ implemented on top of the ASTRA platform.


%% RHB: OK to mention the multi-agent contest?

% \begin{itemize}
% \item refining current ASTRA implementation, that will allow to refine the evaluation
% \item Jason extension implementing {\aser}, and compare it with the ASTRA one
% \item stress {\aser} in practice 
% \item think about the tools: how existing IDE and tools can be extended to provide functionalities exploiting the new features
% \item investigate how the extension either improve or not the possibility to formally analyse the correctness properties
% \item ...
