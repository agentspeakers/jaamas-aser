\todo{OLD CONCLUSION SECTION}

As with any new programming language, there is much future work, some
in fact ongoing. We are currently refining the ASTRA implementation,
trying to make a few optimisations to improve the evaluation results we
reported in this paper. A Jason-based implementation is also under
way; comparison of the performances of the two implementations might
lead to insight that might improve the implementation of the platforms
themselves. 

More generally, full understanding and evaluation of a programming
language takes many years. We expect in the long term to use \aser\ in
the practical development of multi-agent systems, both for real-world
systems and also academic ones (e.g., for the multi-agent programming
contest~\cite{Albrecht18}). However, besides the actual programming
practice, we expect \aser\ to contribute to formal work as
well. Assessing how formal verification of \aser\ systems compares to
the original language is also planned as future work.
%% RHB: OK to mention the multi-agent contest?

% \begin{itemize}
% \item refining current ASTRA implementation, that will allow to refine the evaluation
% \item Jason extension implementing {\aser}, and compare it with the ASTRA one
% \item stress {\aser} in practice 
% \item think about the tools: how existing IDE and tools can be extended to provide functionalities exploiting the new features
% \item investigate how the extension either improve or not the possibility to formally analyse the correctness properties
% \item ...
% \end{itemize}
