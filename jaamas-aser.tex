\begin{abstract}
\todo{OLD VERSION}
In this paper, we introduce AgentSpeak(ER), an extension of the AgentSpeak(L) language tailored to support encapsulation. 
%
The AgentSpeak(ER) extension allows for significantly improving the style of BDI agent programming along relevant aspects, including program modularity and readability, failure handling, and reactive as well as goal-based reasoning. 
%
The paper introduces the novel language, formalises the changes in the usual semantics of AgentSpeak, illustrate the features of the language through examples, and shows results of experiments evaluating the proposed language.
